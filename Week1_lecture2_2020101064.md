# Objective of the class
To prove that there are computational problems that computer cannot solve. We can prove that there are countably many computer programs, where as there are uncountably many computational problems.
1. There exist atleast uncountably many computational problems for which there are no computer problems.

# Theorem-1
1. The set of finite length bit strings {0, 1}* is countable.
2. Any C-program can be represented as a finite length string which belongs to {0, 1}*. So, The number of C-programs are countable. 
   
# Proof of countability of {0, 1}*
1. By showing that there is a one-to-one correspondence between N and {0, 1}*, we can say that {0, 1}* is countable.
2. Any set which is enumarable is a countable set.
3. Let us show the one-to-one correspondence between f: N -> {0, 1}*, By listing the strings in **short-lex order**.

|ε |0 |1 |00 |01 |10 |11 |000 |001 |010 |011 |100 |101 |... |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |10 |11 |12 |13 |... |

> ε is the string of length 0.
> The set {0, 1}* is enumarable. No string is missed. Every string has a number mapped to it.
> Therefore, The set {0, 1}* is countable, which implies the number of C-programs are __countably-infinity__.

# Theorem-2 
1. The powerset of {0, 1}* is uncountable. (p({0, 1}*) is uncountable)
> A language is a subset of set of all binary strings.
> Every element of the p({0, 1}*) is a language.

# Proof of uncountability of p({0, 1}*)
1. Any language can be viewed as as f: {0, 1}* -> {0, 1}.
> If a particular string is present in a language then the '1' is given, else '0'.

|x |ε |0 |1 |00 |01 |10 |11 |000 |001 |010 |011 |100 |101 |... |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|f(x)|1 |0 |1 |1 |0 |0 |0 |1 |0 |1 |1 |1 |0 |... |

> For a particular language
